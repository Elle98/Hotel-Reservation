The project deals with managing the main functions carried out within a Hotel.

The system is divided into two sections: (reservations and customers/rooms) The reservations section allows the receptionist to view all reservations or to create, search or cancel a reservation.

The customer/rooms section allows the receptionist to view the list of available rooms and the list of customers who have stayed overnight.

The program works in the following way: 
● Requests and questions are made to the receptionist, asking to:
1. Select between reservations or customers/rooms
2. In case of response “reservations” to the request in point 1; the receptionist has the options: create reservations/view reservations or manage reservations
3. If he chooses the first option he will be asked to type “create” or “view”
4. If he types “create” the procedure for entering his personal data to create a reservation will begin.
5. If he types “view”, the receptionist will be shown the list of reservations that have been made.
6. Going back if the receptionist types “manage reservations” he can choose whether to search or delete a reservation (if the latter exists).
7. The search and removal of a reservation is done using a specific id that identifies the customer.
8. Going back to the beginning if the receptionist types “customers/rooms” the latter by specifically typing “list of customers” or “available rooms” will be able to view the list of all customers who are staying in the Hotel, or will be able to view all the rooms that are available, or those rooms that have not been booked.
